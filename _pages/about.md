I'm a second year PhD student from [Department of Computing](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/comp/), [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University(PolyU)](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/en/), Hong Kong, China. My research interest includes Graph Neural Networks, Domain Generalization, Spatial Temporal Prediction and Graph Representation Learning.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Jiannong Cao](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csjcao/) of [IMCL Lab](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~labimcl/index.html) from Department of Computing, PolyU. Before that, I received the B.Eng. degree from the [the Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu/) in 2022.
